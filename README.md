# Unveiling the Android App Market: Analyzing Google Play Store Data

This project explores the dynamics of the Android app market using two datasets: 
- **apps.csv** (app details like category, rating, installs, size, price, etc.)  
- **user_reviews.csv** (user review sentiments and feedback)  

## 🔍 Key Objectives
- Perform **data cleaning and preprocessing** to ensure dataset accuracy.  
- Conduct **EDA on apps.csv**: app distribution across categories, installs, ratings, and revenue estimates.  
- Apply **sentiment analysis on user_reviews.csv** to understand customer satisfaction and common complaints.  
- Merge insights from both datasets to highlight:  
  - Categories with **high installs but poor sentiment** (improvement opportunities).  
  - Categories with **small market size but high ratings** (emerging niches).  
- Create **interactive visualizations** (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Power BI/Tableau) to communicate findings.  

## 🛠 Tools & Skills Used
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NLTK/TextBlob  
- **Data Analysis**: EDA, Sentiment Analysis, Feature Engineering  
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Power BI/Tableau  
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub  

## 📈 Insights
- Social, Communication, and Entertainment apps dominate installs.  
- Paid apps don’t always correlate with higher ratings.  
- User sentiment reveals opportunities for improvement in popular categories.
